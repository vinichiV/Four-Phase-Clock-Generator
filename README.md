# Four-Phase Clock Generator
Generating four distinct clock phases, each phase being equally spaced in time (90°).<br>
Since the *Four-Phase Clock Generator* can be considered as **a counter**, for the testbench, we initialize the input value to 0 to ensure that the pulse width of the clock pulses is equal and the phase shift is 90°, as well as to avoid the undefined values.<br>
By using two **D-type flip-flops** (four phases, two bits), we can design a four-phase clock generator circuit (synchronous):
- Input: Initialization pulse.
- Output: 4 clock pulses with 4 distinct phases (p1, p2, p3, p4), each having equal phase shift.<br>
